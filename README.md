# CPP-pool

In total, 10 Modules to make us progressively learn about the c++ essential concepts, such as Classes, Inheritance, Containers, the different ways to modify inputs and outputs, etc.

Since it's 42 and they like to limit us, we could only use stuff from c++98, nothing higher.

Overall I'm feeling pretty confident about my knowledge of c++ after doing these exercises and feel ready to do bigger projects in this awesome language.
